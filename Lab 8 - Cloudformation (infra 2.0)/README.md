# **LAB 8 - CloudFormation (infra 2.0)** #

## Visual Interpretation ##
For our last big leap, we're even foregoing using the AWS Console. Using code to start up AWS services is probably the most efficient way to build our highly available MemeGen site in the cloud. `Infrastructure as code` is one of the fundamental concepts of Dev Ops.

### 1. Remove everything ###
Having everything configured properly feels good. Making a new stack for a different customer will still require you to set everything up manually again though. We have a solution for that in this lab, but you can start by removing everything manually right now. :)

Do **not** remove your __private key__ (Services -> EC2 -> Key Pairs). 

1. Remove the __DynamoDB table__ (Services -> DynamoDB -> Tables -> Select `images-<your_ID>` -> Delete Table -> Delete)
1. Remove the __Autoscaling Group__ (Services -> EC2 -> Auto Scaling Groups -> `lab-ASG-<your_ID>` -> Actions -> Delete -> Yes, Delete)
1. Remove __Load Balancer__ (Services -> EC2 -> Load Balancers -> `lab-ELB-<your_ID>` -> Actions -> Delete -> Yes, Delete)
1. Remove __Route53 record__ (Services -> Route53 -> Hosted Zones -> gluo.cloud. -> `<your_ID>.gluo.cloud.` -> Delete Record Set)
1. Remove your __S3 Bucket__ (Services -> S3 -> Click the record but do not open `lab-<your_ID>-bucket` -> Above the table click "Delete Bucket" -> Type the bucket name -> Confirm)

Once Load Balancer and Autoscaling Groups' instances are gone:

1. Remove the __Launch Configuration__ (Services -> EC2 -> Launch Configurations -> `lab-LC-<your_ID>` -> Actions -> Delete Launch Configuration -> Yes, Delete)
1. Remove 3 __Security Groups__ (Services -> EC2 -> 
    * `lab_SecGroup_ELB_<your_ID>` -> Actions -> Delete Security Group -> Yes, Delete)
    * `lab_SecGroup_EC2_<your_ID>` -> Actions -> Delete Security Group -> Yes, Delete)

### 2. Execute a CloudFormation script ###
Using CloudFormation you can command AWS Services to startup and interconnect with each other using scripts instead of your normal browser interface or AWS Console.
This is a lot faster, makes the structure more intact and readable and is a lot easier to clean up, among many other benefits.

1. Go to `Services -> CloudFormation -> Create Stack`
1. There are multiple ways to create a CloudFormation template or script, there's even a visual editor but we'll stick to code. Press `Browse` and find `cloudformation-application-create.yml` under `Lab 8 - Cloudformation (infra 2.0)` in this repository.
1. Press `Next`.
1. Fill in the form:
    * Stack name: `lab-app-<your_ID>`.
    * StudentIdParam: `<your_ID>`.
    * KeyNameParam: `lab_key_<your_ID>`.
    * AmiParam: `ami-8fd760f6`.
    * Ec2InstanceTypeParam: `t2.micro`.
    * DomainNameParam: `gluo.cloud`.
    * VpcIdParam: `defaultVPC`.
    * PublicSubnetsParam: 
        * `localSubnet0`.
        * `localSubnet16`.
        * `localSubnet32`.
1. Press `Next`.
1. Press `Next`.
1. Check `I acknowledge ...`
1. Press `Create`.

Creating every service will take about 10 minutes.

This script will setup:

* An DynamoDB table functioning as our database.
* An S3 Bucket functioning as our fileserver.
* An Autoscaling Group that creates 2 EC2 Instances.
* A Launch Configuration that uses scripts on the ASG instances to install Apache, MongoDB, PHP7.0, AWSCLI, Composer, MemeGen...
* A Load Balancer that points to any amount of EC2 Instances linked to the Autoscaling Group.
* A Route53 DNS Record pointing to the Load Balancer.

### 3. Verify installation ###
Let's see if our app works.

1. In `Services -> Cloudformation`
    1. Click your cloudformation stack `lab-app-<your_ID>`. 
    1. Click the `Outputs` tab.
        * This provides some handy links to your resources.
    1. Copy the Route53 record `lab-app-<your_ID>.gluo.cloud`
    1. Browse to it.
        * This could give you a nice "The connection was reset" for up to 5-10 minutes up until the stack is created. 
1. Verify the EC2 instances from the Autoscaling Group are connected to the Load Balancer in `Services -> EC2 -> Load Balancers -> Click your Load Balancer -> Click the "Instances" tab`. 
    * Once their status is `InService`, you should be able to connect to the MemeGen web app. 

## End of Lab 8 ##
Et voil√†! This method is much easier, more consistent, readable and less prone to errors. 

Now let's try to break things in the last lab. ([To last lab](../Lab%209%20-%20Chaos%20Engineering))
